## Technical Features

###Stack
* Ruby on Rails
* React.js
* Postgresql

###Models Schema
* Users
* Rooms
* Images
* Bookings

###APIs
* Google Maps API
* Cloudinary API
* Pusher Websocket API

###Modularized Components
React components are abstracted and grouped by logical similarity. This enables improved code maintainability and allows easy iterative design and development.

###Data Integrity
Integrated with React, the flux architecture provides real time reflection of all needed data from the database, allowing dynamic updates and minimal server requests.

## Todos
* refactor DateTime to single method in app context to improve code maintainability
